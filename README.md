# Omegle Clone

Welcome to the Omegle Clone project! This is a simple web-based chat application that mimics the functionality of the popular Omegle website. Users can enter their names, send messages, and interact with a simulated chat environment.

## Live Website

You can access the live version of the Omegle Clone here: [Omegle Clone Live](https://chandranshulg.github.io/omegele-clone/)

## Features

- **User Name Input**: Users can enter their name before starting the chat.
- **Typing Indicator**: Displays when the other person is typing.
- **Sound Notification**: A sound plays when a new message is received.
- **Theming Options**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Character Counter**: Displays how many characters the user has typed out of a 200-character limit.
- **Chat History**: Chat history is saved locally in the browser and restored on reload.

## How It Works

1. Users enter their name in the input field at the top.
2. Users can type messages in the chat input and click "Send" to post them.
3. The chat box will display sent messages with a timestamp.
4. The "Stranger is typing..." indicator shows when the simulated user is preparing a response.
5. Users can toggle between light and dark themes using the "Toggle Dark Mode" button.
6. Chat history is preserved between sessions using `localStorage`.
